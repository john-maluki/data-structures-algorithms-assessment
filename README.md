# [Compulsory Practice]Data Structures and Algorithms Assessment

Data Structures and Algorithms

## Stacks:

**Question 1:** Implement a function is_balanced(expression) that takes a string
containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets,and determines whether
the expression is balanced.

An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing
bracket in the correct order.

sample input =

`expression1 = "([]{})"
expression2 = "([)]"
print(is_balanced(expression1)) # Output: True
print(is_balanced(expression2)) # Output: False`

## Sequences (Lists/Tuples):

**Question 2:** Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that takes a
sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates
removed while maintaining the original order of elements.

sample input =

`input_sequence = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 5]
result = remove_duplicates(input_sequence)
print(result) # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`

## Dictionaries:

**Question 3:** Implement a function word_frequency(sentence) that takes
a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each
word in the sentence.

> Ignore punctuation and consider words in a case-insensitive manner.

sample input =

`sentence = "This is a test sentence. This sentence is a test."
result = word_frequency(sentence)
print(result)`
