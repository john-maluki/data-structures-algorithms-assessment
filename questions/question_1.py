    Question 1: Implement a function is_balanced(expression) that takes a string 
    containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets,and determines whether 
    the expression is balanced. 

    An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing 
    bracket in the correct order.

    sample input = 

    expression1 = "([]{})"
    expression2 = "([)]"
    print(is_balanced(expression1))  # Output: True
    print(is_balanced(expression2))  # Output: False
